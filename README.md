# MyTLAB
A big hw of Basic Programming in Year 1. I am assigned with Part 2.

## Something random

IDK why they let us do the three parts separately. I have to complete some of others' job to make my code run.

However, I copied code from the Internet(details below) to make up some of Part 3. I hope that won't win me a penalty.

## how to use

1. Buy or rent a computer.
2. Buy Windows 10.
3. Install MinGW64.
4. Connect to Internet.
5. Download zip.
6. Unzip.
7. `gcc main.c -o main`
8. `./main`
9. Then you get the three images.

## Opensource projects involved

Well idk how i can finely use other's code. How should I cite them?

## ~~Bugs~~ Features & Todo

1. Not well tested. Never tried on a rectangluar setup where the two sides are of different lengths and ratios of scaling.
2. I mix the colors. So new paints won't cover the old. They **mix** with the old.
3. Two unknown fellows are going to help me make it big.
